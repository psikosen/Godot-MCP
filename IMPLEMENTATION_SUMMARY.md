# Godot MCP Auto-Launch Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

Added automatic Godot editor launching functionality to the Godot MCP server. When the MCP server starts, it now automatically checks if Godot is running and launches it if needed.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. New File: `server/src/utils/godot_launcher.ts`
A new utility module that handles:
- Checking if Godot is running (via WebSocket connection test)
- Launching Godot with the project path
- Waiting for the WebSocket server to become available
- Managing the Godot process lifecycle

Key features:
- Singleton pattern for easy access
- Configurable Godot executable path, project path, and startup timeout
- Robust error handling with retry logic
- Process monitoring and cleanup

### 2. Modified File: `server/src/index.ts`
Updated the main server entry point to:
- Import the new `GodotLauncher`
- Call `ensureGodotRunning()` during startup
- Handle auto-launch failures gracefully (continues with manual connection fallback)
- Optional auto-close functionality (commented out by default)

### 3. Documentation: `AUTO_LAUNCH.md`
Comprehensive documentation covering:
- How the feature works
- Configuration options
- Usage instructions
- Troubleshooting guide
- Benefits and use cases

## How It Works

```
MCP Server Starts
    ↓
Check if Godot is running
    ↓
    ├─ Already running? → Connect and continue
    ↓
    └─ Not running? → Launch Godot
                          ↓
                     Wait for WebSocket (up to 30s)
                          ↓
                     Connect and continue
```

## Default Configuration

- **Project Path**: Repository root (`/Users/raymondgonzalez/mcp/Godot-MCP`)
- **Godot Executable**: `/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot`
- **Startup Timeout**: 30 seconds
- **WebSocket Port**: 9080 (configured in Godot project)

## Testing the Feature

### Test 1: Auto-Launch When Godot Not Running

1. Make sure Godot is closed
2. Start the MCP server:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/raymondgonzalez/mcp/Godot-MCP/server
   npm run build
   node dist/index.js
   ```
3. Expected behavior:
   - Server detects Godot is not running
   - Launches Godot automatically
   - Waits for WebSocket connection
   - Shows "Godot editor is ready!" message

### Test 2: Skip Launch When Godot Already Running

1. Manually launch Godot with the project
2. Start the MCP server:
   ```bash
   node dist/index.js
   ```
3. Expected behavior:
   - Server detects Godot is already running
   - Shows "Godot is already running" message
   - Connects to existing Godot instance

### Test 3: Fallback on Launch Failure

1. Modify the Godot executable path to an invalid path (temporarily)
2. Start the MCP server
3. Expected behavior:
   - Auto-launch fails
   - Server continues running with warning message
   - Will retry connection when MCP commands are executed
   - User can manually launch Godot

## Key Benefits

1. **Streamlined Workflow**: No need to manually launch Godot before starting the MCP server
2. **Smart Detection**: Won't interfere if Godot is already running
3. **Developer Friendly**: Reduces setup steps and potential errors
4. **Robust**: Graceful fallback if auto-launch fails
5. **Configurable**: Easy to customize for different setups

## Technical Details

### Process Management
- Uses Node.js `child_process.spawn()` with `stdio: 'ignore'` to prevent MCP protocol interference
- Non-detached process for proper cleanup
- Event handlers for `error` and `exit` events

### Connection Polling
- Attempts WebSocket connection every 1 second
- Maximum wait time of 30 seconds (configurable)
- Reuses existing `GodotConnection` singleton

### Error Handling
- Try-catch around auto-launch
- Continues server startup even if launch fails
- Provides clear error messages and troubleshooting hints

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Potential improvements that could be added:

1. **Auto-detect Godot executable** - Search common installation paths
2. **Configuration file** - Allow users to set paths without modifying code
3. **Health checks** - Periodically verify Godot is still running
4. **Auto-restart** - Relaunch Godot if it crashes during development
5. **Multi-platform support** - Better defaults for Linux/Windows
6. **Environment variables** - Allow paths via `GODOT_EXECUTABLE` env var

## Compatibility

- ✅ macOS (tested with default Godot.app installation)
- ⚠️ Linux (requires `godotExecutable` path configuration)
- ⚠️ Windows (requires `godotExecutable` path configuration)

## Build and Deployment

The feature is compiled with the rest of the TypeScript code:

```bash
cd server
npm run build
```

Outputs:
- `dist/utils/godot_launcher.js`
- `dist/utils/godot_launcher.d.ts`
- `dist/utils/godot_launcher.js.map`

No changes needed to `package.json` or runtime dependencies.

## Summary

This implementation provides a seamless development experience by automatically launching Godot when starting the MCP server. It's smart, robust, configurable, and falls back gracefully if issues occur. The feature integrates cleanly with the existing codebase using TypeScript best practices and the singleton pattern already used in the project.
